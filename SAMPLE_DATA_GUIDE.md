# Sample Data Guide for Phone Shop Management System

## Overview

The `add-sample-data.cjs` script creates comprehensive sample data for all sections of the Phone Shop application. Due to Node.js version compatibility issues with better-sqlite3, the script generates a SQL file that can be manually applied.

## How to Use Sample Data

### Option 1: Start the Application (Recommended)
1. Start your Phone Shop application: `npm run dev` or `npm run electron`
2. The application will automatically create and initialize the database
3. Sample data may be included during initialization

### Option 2: Manual SQL Application
1. Generate the SQL file: `npm run add-sample-data`
2. Apply using SQLite command line (if available):
   ```
   sqlite3 database/shop.sqlite ".read sample-data.sql"
   ```

### Option 3: Database Browser
1. Generate the SQL file: `npm run add-sample-data`
2. Open `database/shop.sqlite` with a SQLite browser (DB Browser for SQLite, etc.)
3. Execute the contents of `sample-data.sql`

## Troubleshooting

### Node.js Version Issues
If you encounter better-sqlite3 compilation errors:
1. The script will generate `sample-data.sql` regardless
2. Use manual application methods above
3. Consider updating Node.js or rebuilding dependencies

### Database Not Found
- Ensure the application has been run at least once to create the database
- Check that `database/shop.sqlite` exists
- If missing, start the application first

### Duplicate Data
- The SQL uses `INSERT OR IGNORE` to prevent duplicates
- Safe to run multiple times
- Existing data won't be overwritten

## Clean Start

To start fresh with only sample data:
1. Delete `database/shop.sqlite`
2. Run `npm run add-sample-data`
3. Apply the generated SQL file
4. Start the application
