# Multi-Currency Total Payment Migration Progress

## ‚úÖ Completed Steps

### Step 1: Backend Implementation ‚úÖ 
**Status: COMPLETED**

Created comprehensive backend functions in `database/modules/debts.cjs`:

#### Customer Debt Functions:
- `payCustomerDebtTotal()` - Regular total payment with all currencies
- `payCustomerDebtTotalForcedUSD()` - Only pay USD debts with any currency
- `payCustomerDebtTotalForcedIQD()` - Only pay IQD debts with any currency  
- `payCustomerDebtTotalTargeted()` - Wrapper function for currency targeting

#### Personal Loan Functions:
- `payPersonalLoanTotal()` - Regular total payment with all currencies
- `payPersonalLoanTotalForcedUSD()` - Only pay USD loans with any currency
- `payPersonalLoanTotalForcedIQD()` - Only pay IQD loans with any currency
- `payPersonalLoanTotalTargeted()` - Wrapper function for currency targeting

#### Module Exports:
- Added all new functions to module.exports in `debts.cjs`

#### IPC API Exposure:
- Added IPC handlers in `src/main.cjs`:
  - `payCustomerDebtTotal`
  - `payCustomerDebtTotalForcedUSD` 
  - `payCustomerDebtTotalForcedIQD`
  - `payPersonalLoanTotal`
  - `payPersonalLoanTotalForcedUSD`
  - `payPersonalLoanTotalForcedIQD`

#### Key Features Implemented:
- Multi-currency support (USD/IQD)
- Cross-currency payment logic
- Forced currency targeting (USD-only or IQD-only payments)
- Transaction logging and balance updates
- Comprehensive error handling
- Payment history tracking in `debt_payments` table
- Overpayment detection and handling

## üîÑ Next Steps (Pending Implementation)

### Step 2: Customer Debt Frontend 
**Status: PENDING**

Need to create:
- `CustomerTotalPaymentModal.jsx` (similar to `CompanyTotalPaymentModal.jsx`)
- Update `CustomerDebtsSection.jsx` to include "Pay All Debts" button
- Currency selection buttons (All/USD Only/IQD Only)
- Multi-currency input form
- Payment result display

### Step 3: Personal Loan Frontend
**Status: PENDING**

Need to create:
- `PersonalLoanTotalPaymentModal.jsx` (similar to `CompanyTotalPaymentModal.jsx`)
- Update `PersonalLoansSection.jsx` to include "Pay All Loans" button
- Currency selection buttons (All/USD Only/IQD Only)
- Multi-currency input form  
- Payment result display

### Step 4: Integration & Testing
**Status: PENDING**

Need to:
- Test backend functions with sample data
- Test frontend modals and user flow
- Verify transaction logging
- Test edge cases (overpayment, zero amounts, etc.)
- Validate exchange rate handling
- Cross-browser testing

## üìã Implementation Notes

### Backend Logic Patterns:
- **Regular payment**: Pays any unpaid debts/loans regardless of currency
- **Forced USD**: Only targets USD debts/loans, ignores IQD-only items
- **Forced IQD**: Only targets IQD debts/loans, ignores USD-only items
- **Cross-currency**: Can use any currency balance to pay any currency debt
- **Oldest-first**: Always processes debts/loans in chronological order

### Database Structure:
- Uses existing `customer_debts` and `personal_loans` tables
- Leverages existing `payment_usd_amount` and `payment_iqd_amount` columns
- Records transactions in `transactions` table
- Logs detailed payment history in `debt_payments` table

### Error Handling:
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Database transaction safety
- Input validation
- Descriptive error messages
- Console logging for debugging

## üéØ Success Criteria

‚úÖ Backend functions created and exported  
‚úÖ IPC API endpoints exposed  
‚è≥ Frontend modals created  
‚è≥ Customer debts section updated  
‚è≥ Personal loans section updated  
‚è≥ End-to-end testing completed  
‚è≥ User acceptance validation  

## üìÅ Files Modified

### Backend:
- `database/modules/debts.cjs` - Added 8 new functions + exports
- `src/main.cjs` - Added 6 new IPC handlers

### Frontend (Pending):
- `src/components/CustomerDebtsSection.jsx` - Need to add "Pay All" button
- `src/components/PersonalLoansSection.jsx` - Need to add "Pay All" button  
- `src/components/CustomerTotalPaymentModal.jsx` - Need to create
- `src/components/PersonalLoanTotalPaymentModal.jsx` - Need to create

## üîç Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Testing**: Test each backend function with various scenarios
2. **Integration Testing**: Test IPC communication between frontend/backend
3. **UI Testing**: Test modal flows and user interactions
4. **Edge Case Testing**: Overpayments, zero amounts, missing data
5. **Currency Testing**: Cross-currency payments and exchange rates
6. **Transaction Testing**: Verify all database updates and logging
