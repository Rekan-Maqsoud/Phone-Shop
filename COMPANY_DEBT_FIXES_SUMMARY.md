# Company Debt Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **250 IQD Threshold Implementation**
- **Backend**: Updated `markCompanyDebtPaid` function in `database/modules/debts.cjs`
- **Change**: Company debts with remaining amounts less than 250 IQD are now automatically considered fully paid
- **Location**: Lines 403-420 in debts.cjs
- **Logic**: 
  - IQD debts: `isFullyPaid = remainingDebt <= 250`
  - Multi-currency debts: Uses 250 IQD equivalent threshold
  - USD debts: Converts 250 IQD to USD equivalent

### 2. **Multi-Currency Dashboard Partial Payment Fix**
- **Frontend**: Updated `MultiCurrencyDashboard.jsx`
- **Change**: Company debt totals now account for partial payments instead of showing full original amounts
- **Location**: Lines 213-265 in MultiCurrencyDashboard.jsx
- **Logic**:
  - Calculates remaining amounts: `(original_amount) - (payment_amounts)`
  - Applies 250 IQD threshold before including in totals
  - Handles multi-currency, USD, and IQD debts separately

### 3. **Backend getTotalDebts Function Enhancement**
- **Backend**: Completely rewrote `getTotalDebts` function in `database/modules/debts.cjs`
- **Change**: Now accounts for partial payments and 250 IQD threshold
- **Location**: Lines 1033-1100+ in debts.cjs
- **Logic**:
  - Customer debts: Subtracts partial payments
  - Company debts: Subtracts partial payments + applies 250 IQD threshold
  - Personal loans: Handles multi-currency partial payments

### 4. **Company Debts Section UI Fix**
- **Frontend**: Updated `CompanyDebtsSection.jsx`
- **Change**: Total debt calculations now include 250 IQD threshold
- **Location**: Lines 185-205 in CompanyDebtsSection.jsx
- **Logic**: Same threshold logic as dashboard for consistency

### 5. **Buying History Multi-Currency Values**
- **Backend**: Already fixed in previous conversation
- **Status**: `multi_currency_usd` and `multi_currency_iqd` columns are now always set
- **Result**: Should display actual payment amounts instead of "Multi-currency" text

## Testing Required:

1. **Make a company debt payment** - Verify dashboard updates correctly
2. **Create small debt (<250 IQD)** - Should be auto-marked as paid when partial payment brings it below threshold
3. **Check buying history** - Should show actual amounts instead of "Multi-currency"
4. **Multi-currency dashboard** - Should show reduced totals after partial payments

## Files Modified:
- `database/modules/debts.cjs` (Backend logic)
- `src/components/MultiCurrencyDashboard.jsx` (Dashboard calculations)
- `src/components/CompanyDebtsSection.jsx` (UI totals)

All changes maintain backward compatibility and include proper error handling.
