# Personal Loan Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### ❌ Issue 1: Transaction amounts were POSITIVE instead of NEGATIVE
**Problem**: When giving a loan, the transaction recorded positive amounts, making it look like money was coming IN instead of going OUT.

**Fix**: Changed transaction recording in `addPersonalLoan()` to use negative amounts:
```javascript
// BEFORE (WRONG)
'personal_loan',
usd_amount || 0,
iqd_amount || 0,

// AFTER (CORRECT) 
'personal_loan',
-(usd_amount || 0),  // Negative = money going OUT
-(iqd_amount || 0),  // Negative = money going OUT
```

### ❌ Issue 2: Payment currency logic was COMPLETELY WRONG
**Problem**: When paying a USD loan with IQD, it was adding money to USD balance instead of IQD balance.

**Fix**: Changed `markPersonalLoanPaid()` to add money to the ACTUAL currency paid:
```javascript
// BEFORE (WRONG) - Adding converted amounts
if (finalPaymentUSD > 0) {
  settings.updateBalance(db, 'USD', finalPaymentUSD); // Wrong!
}

// AFTER (CORRECT) - Adding actual payment amounts
if (payment_usd_amount > 0) {
  settings.updateBalance(db, 'USD', payment_usd_amount); // Correct!
}
if (payment_iqd_amount > 0) {
  settings.updateBalance(db, 'IQD', payment_iqd_amount); // Correct!
}
```

### ❌ Issue 3: Dashboard looking for wrong transaction pattern
**Problem**: Dashboard was looking for positive amounts for outgoing loans, but transactions are now correctly negative.

**Fix**: Updated dashboard to look for negative amounts and use absolute values for display:
```javascript
// BEFORE (WRONG)
transaction.amount_usd > 0  // Looking for positive

// AFTER (CORRECT)
transaction.amount_usd < 0  // Looking for negative (outgoing)
Math.abs(transaction.amount_usd)  // Use absolute value for display
```

## What Should Now Work Correctly

### ✅ Giving Loans
1. **Balance**: Correctly decreases by the amount loaned
2. **Transaction**: Records negative amount (outgoing money)
3. **Dashboard**: Shows loan given in red under "Personal Loans Given"

### ✅ Receiving Payments  
1. **Balance**: Increases in the ACTUAL currency paid (not converted)
2. **Cross-currency**: If USD loan paid with IQD → IQD balance increases
3. **Transaction**: Records positive amount in payment currency
4. **Dashboard**: Shows payment received in green under "Personal Debt Payments"

### ✅ Dashboard Display
1. **Loans Given**: Red text, shows total loaned out today
2. **Payments Received**: Green text, shows total received today  
3. **Daily Balance**: Both properly included in calculations
4. **Multi-currency**: USD and IQD tracked separately

## Manual Testing Steps

1. **Test Loan Creation**:
   - Give a $50 USD loan
   - Check: USD balance decreases by $50
   - Check: Dashboard shows "$50" in red under "Personal Loans Given"

2. **Test Payment (Same Currency)**:
   - Pay the $50 loan with $50 USD
   - Check: USD balance increases by $50
   - Check: Dashboard shows "$50" in green under "Personal Debt Payments"

3. **Test Cross-Currency Payment**:
   - Give a $50 USD loan
   - Pay it with 72,000 IQD (≈$50)
   - Check: USD balance DOES NOT change
   - Check: IQD balance increases by 72,000
   - Check: Dashboard shows payment correctly

## Files Modified
- `database/modules/debts.cjs`: Fixed transaction amounts and payment currency logic
- `src/components/MultiCurrencyDashboard.jsx`: Fixed dashboard transaction filtering

The logic is now correct and should work as expected!
