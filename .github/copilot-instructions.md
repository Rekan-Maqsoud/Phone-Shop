This project is an Electron + Vite + React desktop app with SQLite, Tailwind CSS, React Router, and AppWrite backup integration. Use modern, clean code and utility-first styling. Follow the folder structure and IPC patterns for Electron security.

Key directives for this task:

    Modify existing files, do not rewrite them. You must apply changes by editing the current code, not by deleting files and creating them from scratch. This is to ensure all existing logic is preserved.

    The entire application is AI-generated. You are responsible for implementing all requirements completely. Do not leave any placeholders, comments, or tasks for a human to finish. The implementation must be fully autonomous and final."

    Work on a single problem and after fixing it check if its correct then more on to next problem , and you dont have to finish them all in one prompt do a few each time 

there are alot of non translated hardcoded texts in the app, you and to make your job easier i have taken screenshots of the app when the app settings was on arabic so every english text you see in the screenshots are missing translator and you need to fix them all
