## Summary of Fixes Applied

### 1. Cashier Page Layout Fixed ✅
- **Issue**: Cart wasn't visible, currency and debt/cash buttons were too large
- **Fix**: 
  - Reduced left panel width from `w-96` to `w-80` to make more room for cart visibility
  - Made currency and payment type buttons smaller with `px-2 py-1.5` and `text-sm` classes
  - Reduced spacing between sections (`mb-3` instead of `mb-4`)

### 2. Multi-Currency Exchange Rate Support ✅
- **Issue**: When items bought in USD are paid in IQD, need to maintain dollar buying price and validate IQD amount
- **Fix**:
  - Created `src/utils/exchangeRates.js` with configurable exchange rate (1 USD = 1440 IQD)
  - Added validation for USD items paid with IQD to ensure sufficient payment
  - Shows warning if IQD payment is less than required amount (USD buying price × 1440)
  - Exchange rate is easily changeable in the utility file

### 3. Multi-Currency Payment Support ✅
- **Issue**: Customers often pay with both USD and IQD
- **Fix**:
  - Added collapsible "Multi-Currency Payment" section in cashier
  - Allows input of both USD and IQD amounts simultaneously
  - Shows exchange rate and total equivalent value
  - Validates total payment against sale amount
  - Stores multi-currency payment data in sale records

### 4. Sales History Currency Totals ✅
- **Issue**: Sales history needed to show separate USD and IQD totals
- **Fix**:
  - Updated `SalesHistoryTable.jsx` to calculate separate currency totals
  - Modified `HistorySearchFilter.jsx` to display separate USD/IQD profit and revenue totals
  - Shows 6 total metrics: Total Profit USD, Total Profit IQD, Total Revenue USD, Total Revenue IQD, Total Sales, Total Products

### 5. Buying History Currency Totals ✅
- **Issue**: Buying history needed to show separate USD and IQD totals
- **Fix**:
  - `BuyingHistoryTable.jsx` already had currency-specific totals calculation
  - Uses the enhanced `HistorySearchFilter` component to display separate currency totals

### 6. Company Debts Currency Separation ✅
- **Issue**: Company debts were showing USD and IQD as the same total
- **Fix**:
  - Verified `CompanyDebtsSection.jsx` correctly separates USD and IQD debts
  - Shows separate totals: "Total Company Debt USD" and "Total Company Debt IQD"
  - Groups debts by company name AND currency for proper separation

### Technical Implementation Details:

#### Exchange Rate Configuration
```javascript
export const EXCHANGE_RATES = {
  USD_TO_IQD: 1440, // Easily changeable daily
  IQD_TO_USD: 1 / 1440
};
```

#### Multi-Currency Validation
- Validates USD item buying prices against IQD payments
- Shows detailed warning messages with required vs provided amounts
- Prevents sales with insufficient payment

#### UI Improvements
- Compact cashier layout with better space utilization
- Responsive currency displays with proper symbols ($ and د.ع)
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback

All fixes have been tested with successful production builds and are ready for use.
