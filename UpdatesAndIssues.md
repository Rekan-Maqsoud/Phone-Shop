issues :

1- loan payment should show the full time date , time and even seconds .

2-marking a company debt as paid doesnt do anything , it says successful but the debt is still there and the balance is the same . and make sure it handles both currencies nicely and accurately 

3-in add purchase modal , the products have stock and QTY which are same , and the catagory is unnecessary since we dont actually have it in the products section

4-in add purchase modal the accessories doesnt have the same input fields as the accessories section and make sure to alien it with the products so they feel similar , for example selecting selecting brand-model or brand-name in a row , and price 

5- add purchase modal fails to add a purchase or debt with items with a database error see attached image , update it to adabt with the recent changes . 

6- discounting 5000 when payment is on IQD the undercostwarning thinks its 5000$ discount and warns me , make sure it can handle different currencies 

7- marking customer debt with different currency as the one we set at the time of sale isnt working, and make sure its handling change exactly like the cashier page would , it needs an overall upgrade.

8- customer debts are mistakefully added to buying history as well which should never happen .
