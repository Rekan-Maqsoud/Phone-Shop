## Current Issues:

### 1. Add Purchase Modal - Stock Addition
- **Issue**: Stock doesn't get added to products/accessories when adding purchases
it should create a new recond of the item doesnt exist , and unachive it if it exists but achived 
- **Status**: not fixed 


### 2. Customer Debt Payment Modal Enhancement
- **Issue**: Modal doesn't show the remaining IQD (see screenshot)
- **Issue**: returning the sale fails before paying ,(balance should stay the same stock gets back to inverntory)
- **Issue**: returning a debt or some sales doesnt return the balance correct ;
- **Issue**: multi currency debt > then paid with single currency still thinks its multi currency and splits the value make sure to prevent that .
- **Status**: Not fixed
