1- reset all data doesnt update incertive UI , make sure the screen is always showing latest data .

2- most of the keyboard short cuts doesnt remove , remove the UI guide or fix them .

3-fix the error of the cashier page that is shown in the screenshot. selling in USD fails.

4- the total profit in sales history table is depending on the paid amount , but in the monthly reports it depends on the product currency , so make them identical carefully , either cope the logic of the monthly report to sales history or vice versa.

5-the return button have errors in sales history , see screenshot 2 

6- returning a quantity in the buying history section didnt update the record to have the correct new value and the edit and return button have no text, see the screenshot , and idk if there is even option to choose which currency balance it should affect.
