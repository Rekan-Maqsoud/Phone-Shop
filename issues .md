2- paying back a company debt should add to the spendings in both daily check ins and monthly reports fix that .

3- company debt saved in IQD  and shown as IQD in the company debt section , but then when i wanna pay it in the paying debt modal it thinks its USD and mistakefully calculates the amount that should be paid

4- paying a customer debt didnt add up to sales and resulted in huge mixcalculations in the daily checkings. 

5- adding incertive have an error saying triggercloudbacup isnt a function

6- adding incertive still results in wrong daily checkin calculations add it to the label of today sales , and rename it with income or smth like that so we can add any type of money we get to that and any money we spend to the spending .













new ones:
1- the add purchase modal doesnt show the correct and current balances.
2-the cashier should ignore changes that are less than 1 USD and , the change should be usually paid with IQD instead of USD . so ignore changes that are less than 250.
