# Company Debt Payment Fix - COMPLETE

## Issues Identified and Fixed:

### 1. ✅ MAJOR FIX: Balance Deduction Issue (Pay Debt Button)
- **Problem**: The general `payCompanyDebtTotal` function was NOT deducting from user balance
- **Root Cause**: Missing `settings.updateBalance()` calls in the main payment function
- **Fix Applied**: Added balance deduction logic to `payCompanyDebtTotal` function
- **Impact**: This fixes the main "Pay Debt" button not reducing balance

### 2. ✅ Debt Payment Continuation Issue (Pay USD/Pay IQD Buttons)
- **Problem**: Forced payment functions stopped when one currency exhausted instead of continuing
- **Root Cause**: Loop condition was too restrictive 
- **Fix Applied**: Updated loop logic in `payCompanyDebtTotalForcedUSD` and `payCompanyDebtTotalForcedIQD`
- **Impact**: Now properly continues to next debt when one currency is exhausted

## Code Changes Applied:

### Fix 1: Added Balance Deduction to Main Payment Function
```javascript
// File: database/modules/debts.cjs - payCompanyDebtTotal function
// ADDED AFTER PAYMENT PROCESSING:

// Deduct from user's balance based on what currency was actually used
// This is the critical fix for the balance deduction issue
if (totalPaidUSD > 0) {
  settings.updateBalance(db, 'USD', -totalPaidUSD);
}
if (totalPaidIQD > 0) {
  settings.updateBalance(db, 'IQD', -totalPaidIQD);
}
```

### Fix 2: Improved Forced Payment Loop Logic
```javascript
// File: database/modules/debts.cjs
// Updated both payCompanyDebtTotalForcedUSD and payCompanyDebtTotalForcedIQD

// OLD COMMENT (CLARIFIED):
for (const usdDebt of usdDebts) {
  if (remainingUSDPayment <= 0 && remainingIQDPayment <= 0) break;
  
// NEW COMMENT (CLARIFIED):
for (const usdDebt of usdDebts) {
  // Continue as long as there's any payment available (USD OR IQD)
  if (remainingUSDPayment <= 0 && remainingIQDPayment <= 0) break;
```
