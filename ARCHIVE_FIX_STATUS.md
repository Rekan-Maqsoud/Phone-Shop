## Archive Fix Status ✅

### **CRITICAL FIX APPLIED** 

**Problem**: `refreshProducts is not a function` error when archiving items.

**Root Cause**: The `refreshProducts` and `refreshAccessories` functions were included in the dependency array of the useAdmin hook but were NOT being returned in the admin object.

**Solution**: Added the refresh functions to the returned admin object in `src/components/useAdmin.js`:

```javascript
// Now included in the returned admin object:
refreshProducts, refreshAccessories, refreshSales, refreshDebts, refreshCompanyDebts, refreshBuyingHistory, refreshMonthlyReports,
```

### **TEST STEPS**
1. **Restart the app** (important - the hook needs to be reinitialized)
2. **Try archiving a product or accessory**
3. **Verify the item moves to archived section immediately**
4. **Check for any error messages**

### **Expected Results**
- ✅ No "refreshProducts is not a function" error
- ✅ Archive operation succeeds 
- ✅ UI refreshes immediately showing item in archived section
- ✅ Success toast notification appears

### **Backup Plan**
If you still see issues after restarting:

1. **Check console for new error messages**
2. **Use browser console to test**: 
   ```javascript
   // This should now work without errors
   console.log('Admin refresh functions:', {
     refreshProducts: typeof admin?.refreshProducts,
     refreshAccessories: typeof admin?.refreshAccessories
   });
   ```

### **Files Modified**
- `src/components/useAdmin.js` - Added refresh functions to returned admin object

The fix is minimal and surgical - only adding the missing functions to the return object without changing any logic.
