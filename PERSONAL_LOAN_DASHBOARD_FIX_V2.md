# Personal Loan Dashboard Fix - Transaction Refresh Issue

## Root Cause Found ✅

The issue was that the **PersonalLoansSection** component was NOT refreshing the transactions list after adding a personal loan or making a payment.

### The Problem:
1. User adds a personal loan → Transaction created in database ✅  
2. PersonalLoansSection refreshes loans and balances ✅
3. **BUT** PersonalLoansSection does NOT refresh transactions ❌
4. MultiCurrencyDashboard uses stale transactions data ❌
5. Dashboard doesn't show the new loan transaction ❌

### The Fix Applied:

#### 1. Added DataContext Import
```javascript
import { useData } from '../contexts/DataContext';

export default function PersonalLoansSection({ admin, t, showConfirm }) {
  const { refreshTransactions } = useData(); // NEW: Access to refresh function
```

#### 2. Added Transaction Refresh After Loan Creation
```javascript
if (result?.success) {
  // ... existing success logic ...
  fetchLoans();
  fetchBalances();
  
  // NEW: Critical fix - refresh transactions for dashboard
  if (refreshTransactions) {
    await refreshTransactions();
  }
}
```

#### 3. Added Transaction Refresh After Loan Payment
```javascript
if (result?.success) {
  // ... existing success logic ...
  fetchLoans();
  fetchBalances();
  
  // NEW: Critical fix - refresh transactions for dashboard  
  if (refreshTransactions) {
    await refreshTransactions();
  }
}
```

## What This Fixes:

### ✅ **Loan Creation**
1. Add $500 personal loan
2. Transaction gets created with negative amount: `amount_usd: -500`
3. **PersonalLoansSection now calls `refreshTransactions()`**
4. **Dashboard gets fresh transaction data**
5. **Dashboard shows "$500" in red under "Personal Loans Given"**

### ✅ **Loan Payments**  
1. Pay loan with any currency
2. Transaction gets created with positive amount
3. **PersonalLoansSection now calls `refreshTransactions()`**
4. **Dashboard gets fresh transaction data** 
5. **Dashboard shows payment in green under "Personal Debt Payments"**

## Testing Steps:

1. **Add a personal loan** (any amount)
   - Should immediately appear in dashboard under "Personal Loans Given" (red)
   
2. **Make a payment** on any loan
   - Should immediately appear in dashboard under "Personal Debt Payments" (green)
   
3. **Cross-currency payment** (pay USD loan with IQD)
   - Should add to correct currency balance
   - Should appear correctly in dashboard

## Files Modified:
- `src/components/PersonalLoansSection.jsx`: Added DataContext import and `refreshTransactions()` calls

This was a classic data synchronization issue - the transaction was being created but the UI wasn't being notified to refresh the transactions list that the dashboard depends on.
