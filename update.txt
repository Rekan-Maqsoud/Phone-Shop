"You are tasked with updating an application based on the requirements in the provided .txt file.

Key directives for this task:

    Modify existing files, do not rewrite them. You must apply changes by editing the current code, not by deleting files and creating them from scratch. This is to ensure all existing logic is preserved.

    The entire application is AI-generated. You are responsible for implementing all requirements completely. Do not leave any placeholders, comments, or tasks for a human to finish. The implementation must be fully autonomous and final."
