// Test file to demonstrate the fixed double-counting issue in FinancialSummaryModal

/*
BEFORE (Double-counting issue):
- Customer buys $100 item on debt → Sale record created: $100
- Customer pays the $100 debt → Balance increases by $100
- Financial Summary would count:
  * Balance: $100 (from debt payment)
  * Customer Debt: $0 (debt was paid)
  * Net Worth: $100 + $0 = $100 ✓ Correct

But if we also counted the sale as revenue, we'd get:
  * Balance: $100 (from debt payment)
  * Sales Revenue: $100 (from the sale)
  * Net Worth: $100 + $100 = $200 ❌ WRONG! Double-counting

AFTER (Fixed):
- Customer buys $100 item on debt → Sale record created: $100
- Customer pays the $100 debt → Balance increases by $100
- Financial Summary now:
  * Original Balance: $100 (from debt payment)
  * Adjustment: -$100 (subtract the paid debt to prevent double-counting)
  * Adjusted Balance: $0
  * Customer Debt: $0 (debt was paid)
  * Net Worth: $0 + $0 = $0 ✓ Correct!

The customer's payment represents the conversion of debt to cash, not new value.
The financial summary now correctly shows that:
1. Unpaid customer debts are counted as assets (money owed to us)
2. When debts are paid, they become balance (cash) but are adjusted to prevent double-counting
3. Net worth accurately represents actual business value
